<a id="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WHAT IS IT?</h2>

<p>This model demonstrates the process of collaborative and value-centric design for engineered sociotechnical systems across a technology possibility space, a design possibility space.  The model generates this design possibility space, conceptually similar to an economic production possibility space, via a fitness landscape.  The resulting design landscape provides a generalizable representation of various potential designs (i.e. points in the design possibility space) and their corresponding fitness (e.g. value).  This model builds on models by Uri Wilensky (2007a, 2007b) and David McAvity (2006). The resulting model enables the study of and demonstrates:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b> Lateral Alignment in Collaborative Networks </b>
-- Analogy of mutation allows us to explore when and how lateral alignment within a design team (i.e. incorporating disciplines and backgrounds outside of current team makeup) may lead to an improved design (e.g. value) and to what extent.</li>
<li><b> Collaborative Networks on a Landscape with an Augmented Hill Climbing Approach </b></li>
<li><b> Value-centric Design as a Fitness Landscape </b></li>
<li><b> Design Teams and Collaborative Design Teams </b></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>HOW IT WORKS</h2>

<p>Theoretically the fitness landscape shown corresponds to a NK-fitness landscape model where ruggedness of the space is determined by the smoothness variable (a composite of the NK values in the NK-fitness landscape).  The surface in the model has both smoothness (i.e. degree patch neighbors have equivalent range values) and range characteristics (i.e. height or fitness); in addition, the number of components, N, from the NK theory relates to the dimensionality of the world.  The model places agents (e.g. designers) into this resulting design landscape where they create collaborative networks that navigate the space using the hill climbing procedures and other management strategies.   The landscape also provides a representation of a phenotype space, from biological sciences, where the attributes of fitness are binomial (e.g. quality and cost as an example in design).</p>

<p>These design agents also interact with their environment and are subject to their own fitness.  In this application, how long an engineer would spend exploring options depends on its fitness (i.e. less time is spent on designs with less fitness).  This has a biological comparison of natural selection (i.e. the fitness of real organisms is related to the probability of surviving until reproductive age and creating offspring). This natural selection pressure relates to the fitness of the agents location in the design space (i.e. a design concept), aside from this influence the model assumes each collaboration agent has the same probability to move and influence the design forward.  </p>

<p>Additionally, the model allows the landscape to change with time; this allows the model to demonstrate the importance of collaborations to continually explore their design space, especially in high flux work environments.  The changes in this landscape represent many activities for the designers and their collaborators; these changes may mean modifying or changing design configurations as requirements change (e.g. Engineering Change Proposals).  And, at a further abstracted level of the analogy, this changing landscape also demonstrates the need to develop organizational entities to pursue new technical systems as previous designs face obsolescence. </p>

<p>To accomplish the creation of this model, we combine aspects from several well-studied models.  These included building on modeled concepts from collaborative network formation and extending these essential team dynamics into the domain of biological fitness landscapes.  In particular, the adapted model leverages a team assembly model presented by Guimera, Uzzi, Spiro, &amp; Amaral (2005) and remixes elements of the Uri Wilensky model (2007).  </p>

<p>In this model at each tick a new team is assembled and the members of the team are either inexperienced "newcomers" or are established "incumbents" who were previous participants (i.e. on the team more than once).  The likelihood that a new team member is choosen is given by the slider bar in the user interace. </p>

<p>Similiarly, the team may appoint an incumbent with a given probability.  If possible the team will try to select an incumbent  from the current team; however, if there are no currently available team members that are incumbents the team will appoint previous collaborators from the network to join the team.  The probability of this occurence is dictated by a slider bar in the user interface.  </p>

<p>This application of this team concept extends the collaborative model onto a design fitness landscape.  At each tick that a new team member introduces a "newcomer" it does so with a distance equal to a random value up to the mutagenic distance input by the user. This concept of mutagenic distance represents conceptual alignment, the further the mutagenic distance the more relevant diversity and skillsets that a group is willing to integrate into its collaboration.</p>

<p>In the model, newcomers are colored blue and incumbents are colored yellow.  The blue links similiarly represent the interactions between two newcomers, green links represent newcomer-incumbent interactions, yellow links represent incumbent-incument collaborations, and red links indicate repeate collaborations between designers. These links are established at the most recent collaboration (i.e. the links are determined when the agent is actively engaging as part of the core team).  As alluded in the past, the fitness of the space around a current collaborative design-team space dictates the likelihood that a team member will be able to introduce a "newcomer" and the mutation rate dictates the likely conceptual diversity that a "newcomer" will bring to the team.  </p>

<p>Other strategies aside from these mechanics, such as the use of a traditional hill climbing procedure are enabled in the model via user selection.  This model adopts as its defaults techniques from the research that have shown to be effective in driving the design process.  In particular this means using a modified form of this hill climbing approach (i.e. the coalesce? input), an approach that searches out the landscape for peaks but while also allowing for natural selection processes to drive the process when no known peak to the collaboration meets the requirements of the design. Furthermore, this set of default strategies also entails making use of a dynamic mutation rate, a rate that dictates, in this model, the willingness of the group to incorporate diverse team members.  This rate changes with time to adapt to the situation the group faces. Other userful models strategies include the possibility of dynamically ramping up the selectivity required for continuing on a partiuclar design (i.e. reproduction), essentially this conceptually may represent a design manager's pressure to bring about consensus.  This tool helps to address issues where multiple competing peaks makes the final selection of a design too timely for the design process (in biological terms this helps to alleviate allopatric speciation). </p>

<i> <b> Advanced Controls and Strategy </b></i> </h3>

<p>These controls allow the user to modify core elements of the model (e.g. aging process, down-time limitations, hill climbing method for searching out fitness) and allows the user to try out potentially useful strategies.  These strategies are experimental attempts to simulate concepts, such as punctuated equilibrium.  In this particular strategy, the team increasingly seeks collaboration farther outside of its current thinking locus (i.e. it increases its mutation rate) while also assessing its current progress.  It increases it up to a maximum and if it still hasn't achieved success it focuses on its current location, and then increasing mutation in a loop untill it has achieved success.  Other various strategies conceptually relate to group consensus and agreement.</p>

<h2>
<a id="things-to-notice" class="anchor" href="#things-to-notice" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>THINGS TO NOTICE</h2>

<h4>
<a id="collaboration-networks--team-dynamics" class="anchor" href="#collaboration-networks--team-dynamics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Collaboration Networks &amp; Team Dynamics</h4>

<p>The model captures the basic features of collaboration networks that can influence or stifle innovation in creative enterprises, the relative compositions of a collaborative team. The type of team members (i.e. experience/familiarity) most likely to join the collaborative effort are varied in the model through the values <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>. </p>

<p>The first of feature captured by the model is characterizing the distribution of the type of the connection between collaborators.  This distribution can be seen in the <b>Link Type plot</b>, and is one of the clearest indicators into the probability of success for a team (Guimera et al. 2005). An overabundance of newcomers (seen in the newcomer-newcomer blue colored links and agents) might indicate that a field is not taking advantage of experienced members or that no experienced members are available. On the other hand, a multitude of repeat collaborations (orange colored agents) and incumbents (seen in the incumbent-incumbent yellow colored links and agents) may indicate a lack of diversity in ideas or experiences.</p>

<p>The second essential feature captured in the model is characterization of the connectivity of the collaboration network. For example, Wilensky (2007a) points out that some consider many academic fields as comprised of an “invisible college” of loosely knit academic communities. Conversely, other communities, such as patent networks, tend to consist of isolated clusters or chains of inventors. This measure is taken as the percentage of agents in the large connected chain of collaborators and is seen in the <b>Core Agents plot</b>.</p>

<p>The model allows the experimenter to visualize the emergent networks of interactions and their topologies as these teams navigate the fitness landscape. New collaborations or synergies among teams naturally tend to the center of the display, in the traditional model.  However, this model uses the hill climbing algorithm and the fitness landscape to move the collaborative network across the design possibility space. Teams or clusters of teams with few connections to new collaborations naturally “float” away from the current collaboration. Newcomers always hatch near a current agent if mutation is turned off; however, if mutation is enabled the new-comer will come from a different location on the fitness landscape and will have his own fitness (e.g. design idea) to contribute and can help move the group. Incumbents, which are chosen at random, may be located in any part of the landscape. Thus, collaborations amongst newcomers and or distant team components tend toward the network in the absence of mutation and disconnected clusters are repelled.</p>

<p>Finally, note that the structure of collaboration networks in the model can change dramatically over time. Initially, only new teams are generated as the collaborative effort has not existed long enough for members to retire or lose interest / ability to contribute (two factors influence the death of an agent, <i>age</i> and <i>downtime</i>). However, after a period of time <b>max-downtime</b>, inactive agents begin to retire and <b>age</b>, as a result the number of agents becomes relatively stable.  The emergent effects of <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> become more apparent in this equilibrium stage. The end of the growth stage is often marked by a drop in the connectivity of the network Wilensky (2007a); this drop in connectivity is also compounded by the fact that agents (i.e. designers) that are <i>less fit</i> (i.e. pursuing suboptimal design) have less opportunity to produce in the model because they die out sooner.</p>

<h4>
<a id="fitness-landscapes" class="anchor" href="#fitness-landscapes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fitness Landscapes</h4>

<p>A fitness landscape is often used to visualize the relationships in the biological sciences to represent relationships between genotypes and the likelihood of reproductive success in a species (i.e. <i> fitness </i>).  However, more recently the use of these landscapes have been applied in economic and performance measurement literature (Triantis and Keller, 2013).  In particular the NK landscape developed by Stuart Kauffman and Eric Weinberger (1989) provides for a tunable rugged fitness landscapes that has proven valuable in evolutionary biology, immunology, optimization, and organizational theory.  </p>

<p>In general in the NK model, <i>N</i> is the number of characteristics or parts of an organization (e.g. cost, quality).  Each of these <i>N</i> characteristics exist in <i>A</i> number of states.  This <i>A</i> to the power of <i>N</i> can be represented in a binary string with fitness values randomly assigned.  Finally, <i>K</i> represents the interdependence from zero to <i>N - 1</i>, with <i>N - 1</i> being maximally interdependent (i.e. each characteristic is affected by all the other characteristics).  In this model the parameters for roughness and range roughly approximate these tunable characterstics.</p>

<p>In our landscape, if each agent were unconstrained by a collaborative network the agents would gradually drift-up up the fitness landscape to local fitness peaks, although frequently groups of turtles may survive for a time away from the peaks. In this case, these groups would represent less than optimally fit subgroups who survive by random chance. In our case and in this simulation, the networks may also fluctuate and, in fact, become stuck in local minimum as well.</p>

<p>The <b>Average Fitness of Team</b> plot shows the average fitness of the team (i.e. fitness of emerging design concept), but with some fluctuations due to team members. </p>

<p>The landscape can also lead to <i>genetic drift</i> events when the team is forced into two groups where one will die out, even if both groups have similar fitness (sometimes a fitter subgroup may die out as a result). </p>

<h4>
<a id="hill-climbing" class="anchor" href="#hill-climbing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hill Climbing</h4>

<p>This algorithm makes turtles climb hills (i.e. follow the gradient of the environment).  It utilizes the <i><b>UPHILL</b></i> command, which makes the turtle examine its eight neighboring patches and move to the center of the patch with the highest value (in the event of a tie, NetLogo breaks the tie randomly). </p>

<p>-- When the mutation is set to zero and there is no dynamic mutation strategy enabled, you can notice the frequency that agents get stuck in attractors that are local minimums and sticking points that are less than the desired design performance/value (i.e. stopping-fitness).</p>
